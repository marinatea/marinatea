## Feel free to check out some of my PROJECTS:

‚úÖ **Order Management Application for Restaurants**

__React.js / Next.js / Railway / SCSS Module / Sanity__

*This application was created to streamline the order process in a restaurant, improving communication between staff and the person responsible for placing orders with suppliers. Its intuitive interface optimizes daily* *operations, minimizing errors and saving time.*

*Features:*

*Product search and sorting: Employees can easily search for missing products and sort them by category and store for efficient ordering.*
*Automatic cart sorting from the admin side: Products are automatically sorted by store, simplifying the order process and saving time.*
*Unique login codes: Each employee is assigned a unique code to track orders, providing full transparency for admins.*
*Device compatibility: The app is optimized for mobile use with responsive design for both smartphones and computers.*
*Development plan: In the future, I plan to add a feature for users and admins to add missing products through a simple form. This will make the app more dynamic and flexible. Notifications will also be added to keep* *admins informed of new orders for faster response times.*

*Benefits: The app simplifies restaurant processes, saves time, and reduces errors. Automation allows staff to focus on more valuable tasks, while admins maintain full control over orders and the supply process.*
